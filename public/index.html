    <h1>Welcome to My Static Web Page!</h1>
    
    <p>This is a sample paragraph of text that could go on for a little while. It's not terribly exciting, but it will do for the purposes of this example.</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>List item 1</li>
      <li>List item 2</li>
      <li>List item 3</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>That's it for now. Thanks for visiting!</p>
